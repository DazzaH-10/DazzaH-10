- 👋 Hi, I’m @DazzaH-10
- 👀 The main languages that I've used (in no particular order) have been Delphi, BBC BASIC (for Risc OS and Windows), Fox-Pro v2.5 (Professional) / v2.6 (Standard) (for systems I wrote for work over 20 years ago! :), C / C++, Sculptor (used in a job as a Trainee Programmer over 30 years ago!) and COBOL (for doing City & Guilds certificates at college in the UK).
- I'm currently trying to get motivated to move back into doing some programming in my spare time, so I thought I would review some of my work from years gone by and look to upload the source code to Github.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
