- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DazzaH-10
- ðŸ‘€ The main languages that I've used (in no particular order) have been Delphi (the main language I use these days), BBC BASIC (for Risc OS and Windows), Fox-Pro v2.5 (Professional) / v2.6 (Standard) (for systems I wrote for a job I had over 20 years ago! :), C / C++ (both used in my spare time and for an Open University course I did), Sculptor (used in a job as a Trainee Programmer over 30 years ago!), COBOL (for doing City & Guilds certificates at college in the UK) and SQL (used with various databases and servers).
- I'm currently trying to get motivated to move back into doing some programming in my spare time, so I thought I would review some of my work from years gone by and look to upload the source code to Github, who knows someone might find it useful :)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
